Inspirational Quotes from Your Team in Space
--------------------------------

This page lists the inspirational quotes for you and your team in space.
This is a family-oriented team, so only post stuff you are comfortable
showing to your family. If your family is seriously abnormal, my
condolences, and I'm going to reject your sadly twisted pull request.

To add a quote, edit `editme.html`. Please do not edit any other files.

The page is hosted under:
[http://tutorials.git.bitbucket.org](http://tutorials.git.bitbucket.org)

Images are encouraged, but should not be committed to this repo. So please
link directly to externally hosted content.

The `editme.html` is in XHTML format. This is a little stricter than HTML and
among other things requires every tag to be explicitly closed. For the
`<img />` tag that means it MUST end with `/>`.

Please don't change another user's quote as I'll reject that as well. After
all, some quotes are meaningful to the people who submit them.

**NOTE**: For some reason many editors are placing an additional space before
the start tag for the file `<!--`. This causes our parser to reject the pull request.
You can check for this error after you push your change to your repository by doing 
the following. 

1. Click **Source**. 
2. Click the `editme.html` file.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Look for a red dot next to the start tag `<!--`.

	a. If there is a red dot, place your cursor between it and the `<!--` and press 
           backspace or delete to remove the extra space.
	   
	b. If there is no red dot you should be fine. 
	
5. Click **Commit** if you made a change or **Cancel** if you did not. 

**Bonus!** you just learned how to use the Bitbucket online editor.
